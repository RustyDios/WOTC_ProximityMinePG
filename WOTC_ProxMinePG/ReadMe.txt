I created an XCOM 2 Mod Project!

This mod provides a proving ground project to create a singular powerful non-concealment breaking Proximity Mine after the Andromedon Autopsy

Also gives the Reaper class an alternative proximity trigger to the claymore

((Will also give a singular Proximity Stun Mine if the Pathfinders MOD is installed))

My first released XCOM2 mod
Alot of the costs, damages etc should be adjustable in the config file

Created by RustyDios, with help from RoboJumper, Iridar, Puma and the XCOM2 Modders Discord

## ~ Enjoy

[h1]What is this?[/h1]
This mod adds a Proving Ground Project to create powerful Proximity Mines on completion of the Andromedon autopsy.

[b]These mines can be thrown without breaking concealment and when detonated by enemy movement will also not break concealment.[/b]

You will also get a whole new [i]Claymore[/i] weapon that will give you an additional Claymore to throw during missions. This [i]Proximity Claymore[/i] will not affect your Reapers standard Claymore/Homing Mine charges, but it should respect extra range and damage from the [i]Shrapnel[/i] ability.

You can only have one each of these non-concealment breaking mines but the items are re-useable. Adjustable in the configs.

The project costs 250 supplies and an Elerium Core, adjustable in the config files as well as if they break or retain concealment on throw and explosion, and if they can be built more than once and even if you can start a campaign with these unlocked from the beginning. 

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
It should do the same non-concealment break for the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1229048071] Pathfinder Proximity Stun Mine [/url] and the project will also give you one of these on completion.
Should integrate seemlessly with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2286909473] Superior Explosives [/url]

To my knowledge I've not overiden anything so it shouldn't break anything, bug reports welcome.

[h1]FAQ[/h1]
[list]
[*]]You could have done 'this' a better way
... Thanks, this was my first XCOM2 mod, I hope you like it
[*]Vanilla/LW2 Version? 
... Not likely
[*]LWOTC or CI Version? 
... I can't see why it wouldn't work with them?
[*]PGOv2?
... I don't see the need for it for this mod
[*]Can I change 'this' ?
... Check the Configs. If I don't have a config value for it, then it is likely something that couldn't be easily changed.

Okay, so I had a bit more time to look into HotBlooded's new Superior Explosives and from what I can see these two mods should be innately compatible right out the the gate. 
His tier 2 & 3 proximity mines already have the retained concealment on throw and use the same detonation ability as the tier 1 (with different damage values), 
so this mods changes to the concealment breaking for detonation will apply to those tiers too.

The "attracting lost" options from this mod will only apply to the tier 1 mine, which I think is fine as the higher tiers make more sound/damage so should call the lost regardless.

My Proving Ground project will award 1x Proximity Claymore (for your Reapers), 1x Proximity Stun Mine (if you have Claus' Pathfinders) 
and 1x Tier 1 Proximity Mine (which the game should automatically work out and upgrade to the tier you have unlocked - as you would have done the Andromedon Autopsy already to be doing my project)

The rest of the config values don't actually overlap and should all slot together.
